# Business Question
<b>The data below, as well as its context, is completely fictitious.</b>

In a meeting with the human resources team of the company we work for, we were informed that many employees leave the company after two years. 

It was reported that the cost of leaving one employee and hiring another is approximately $15000.00. In addition, we lose productivity in the periods between the departure of an employee and the entry of another

Our goal is then to help identify employees who are most likely to leave the company. The thought solution was to develop a probability estimation model.


# Solution
  
## Proposal
Our goal is to provide a model in production for the human resources team, in addition it would be interesting if we wrote a report with some insights into the phenomena that may be influencing the dismissal of these employees.

Based on information about the employee, the model should return an estimate of the probability of that employee leaving the company in the next two years.


## Project planning



## Procedure
 
### What are the characteristics of the employees who leave the company?
 
 To answer this question the following steps will be followed:

- Collect data in Kaggle;
- Clean the data;
- Feature engineering;
- Performing an exploratory analysis we will look for the best features that describe a turnover employee.
- Return this in a report.

### Once the best features have been identified, how do we construct the model?
 
 To construct the model, the following steps will be followed:

- Data preprocessing(OneHotEncoding, normalization, imbalanced data);
- Feature selection;
- Modeling and choosing the best estimator;
- Hiperparameter tuning;
- Evaluating final model on test data;
- Deploy the model to consumption;

# Results

## Report


## Model

 
 
# Business Evaluation

With the insights and the model built, human resources will be able to save expenses with layoffs and new hires just by identifying the employees likely to leave before they happen, and thus carry out some treatment with them.

# Conclusion

At the end of this project it was possible to reach a very good number for reducing the spending of human resources company sector, the human resources manager now has in hand which characteristics a employee that will left the company has and a model that predict if a specific employee will turnover, being thus it is correct to say that the main objective of this project was successfully achieved.

# Next steps

To further improve the model and generate more accurate predictions, we may collect more data and seek to identify other employee characteristics.
