# Business Question
<b>The data below, as well as its context, is completely fictitious.</b>

The company we work for has a problem where a significant number of good employees leave the company after a certain period. 

The company's human resources manager wants to understand the reasons and characteristics of an employee who will leave the company two years before it happens, in order to take the necessary steps to try to keep that employee, such as bonuses, etc.

So, in this project, the objective is to analyze the data and help the manager to avoid the turnover of good employees by answering the questions below:
<b>
  
- What are the characteristics of the employees who leave the company?
  
- How can we predict whether an employee will leave the company two years from now?
</b>
  # Solution Strategy
  
  The final product will be:
- Report with the most important characteristics of the turnover employees;
- Classification model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company in two years;
  
  ## Tools 
 <p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3.9</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a></li>
  </ul>

 ## Procedure
 
 ### <b>What are the characteristics of the employees who leave the company?</b>
 
 To answer this question the following steps will be followed:

- Collect data in Kaggle;
- Clean the data;
- Feature engineering;
- Performing an exploratory analysis we will look for the best features that describe a turnover employee.
- Return this in a report.

### <b>Once the best features have been identified, how do we construct the model?</b>
 
 To construct the model, the following steps will be followed:

- Data preprocessing(OneHotEncoding, normalization, imbalanced data);
- Feature selection;
- Modeling and choosing the best estimator;
- Evaluating final model;
- Deliver the model so that the Machine Learning team can put it into production;
 
 # Financial Results

With the insights and the model built, human resources will be able to save expenses with layoffs and new hires just by identifying the employees likely to leave before they happen, and thus carry out some treatment with them.

# Conclusion

At the end of this project it was possible to reach a very good number for reducing the spending of human resources company sector, the human resources manager now has in hand which characteristics a employee that will left the company has and a model that predict if a specific employee will turnover, being thus it is correct to say that the main objective of this project was successfully achieved.

# Next steps

To further improve the model and generate more accurate predictions, we may collect more data and seek to identify other employee characteristics.
